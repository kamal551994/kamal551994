🔥 About Me

Great testing isn’t just about finding bugs — it’s about ensuring confidence in every release.

I’m a QA Automation Engineer with hands-on experience in building scalable automation frameworks using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Cucumber BDD, backed by strong manual testing fundamentals. I enjoy solving real testing challenges such as improving coverage, stabilizing regression suites, and enabling faster, high-quality deployments.

I’m currently growing toward an SDET role, exploring API automation, Playwright, and AI-assisted testing workflows.
